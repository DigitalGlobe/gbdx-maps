**The goal of the DG Platform is to become the place where Producers and Consumers
come together to create location intelligence for our changing world.**

The Platform makes computation on and visualization of our 15 year imagery
archive possible at a massive scale. These unique capabilities enable our customers to
solve large-scale geospatial problems and to derive actionable insight based on the results.

Platform Stories contains examples where the Platform is deployed to solve compelling
geospatial problems. Our goal is to help you get started on the Platform and
to inspire and guide you to create your own algorithms and be part of the exciting
Platform Ecosystem.

### To run the examples
