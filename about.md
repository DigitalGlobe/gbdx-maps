**The goal of the GBDX Platform is to become the place where Producers and Consumers come together to create location intelligence for our changing world.**

The Geospatial Big Data (GBDX) Platform makes computation on and visualization of our 15 year imagery
archive possible at a massive scale. These unique capabilities enable our customers to
solve large-scale geospatial problems and to derive actionable insight based on the results.

GBDX Stories contains examples where GBDX is deployed to solve compelling
geospatial problems. Our goal is to help you get started on GBDX, and
to inspire and guide you to create your own algorithms and be part of our exciting Ecosystem.
